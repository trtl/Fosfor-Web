                    <h2>HOW IT ALL<br>STARTED</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fosfor arose out of the scene — slowly &amp; organically, through years spent close to sound.
                        Long before becoming a platform of our own, we were shaped by the scene and its culture,
                        hungry to push it further.
                        Everything took shape from a need for space: a place for heavier, more textural and
                        uncompromising sounds on the edge of existing frameworks. What began as an extension of
                        a like-minded label has evolved into something independent — with its own identity, vision,
                        and pace.
                        Today, Fosfor is a platform for niche electronic music — spanning EBM, electro, industrial,
                        and darker forms of 4/4. We focus on texture over trends, atmosphere over formulas, and
                        sound as a tool for exploration. Through releases, collaborations, and initiatives like
                        SUBSTANCES, we support emerging creators and encourage experimentation across forms
                        and disciplines.
                        Fosfor continues to shine brighter through people, sound, and shared process — shaped by
                        the scene it comes from and the future it’s building.

                    <h3>KABAHART</h3>
                    <p class="description">
                        Wielding sound like a tool of magic, KabaharT merges rhythms, textures, and layers into
                        dark, raw &amp; energetic landscapes. His musical journey began in childhood, inspired by
                        Deadmau5, passing through metal and trap experiments before fully embracing electronic
                        music, where sound becomes a direct extension of the creator.
                        Working exclusively with hardware, his sound balances the soft and sharp, the gentle and
                        aggressive, infused with Witch-House, EBM, and a dash of Aggrotech for that crisp bite.
                        KabaharT leads the sonic explorations of SUBSTANCES, hammers out tracks for breakfast
                        and turns his live performances into immersive rituals of sound and energy.
