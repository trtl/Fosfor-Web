                <h3>TRACK PRODUCTION CONTEST CREATED WITH INTENT</h3>
                <p>
                    SUBSTANCES is a collection of sounds for those unafraid to explore and experiment.
                    Textures, layers, and rhythms form a foundation for your creative ideas, giving shape to the
                    concepts spinning in your mind.
                    Curated by KabaharT and produced along with fellow sound fanatics, the pack blends raw
                    energy with meticulous detail. Every hit, one-shot, and loop is designed to inspire, challenge,
                    and push your sonic boundaries.
                    More than a pack, SUBSTANCES is a platform for emerging producers – a test, a challenge,
                    and an opportunity to face fear, give it your all, and release your unshackled self into the
                    world. Through contests, collaborations, and live showcases, Fosfor supports creators in
                    turning experimentation into fully realized tracks, performances, and releases.
                    Dive in, create, and let sound speak what words cannot.

                    The creative contest put simply
                    Lithuania’s electronic music scene has been inspiring us for a long time, and now’s the time
                    to give something back. Not only are we releasing our first sample pack for free, but we‘re
                    also inviting you to take part in our creative contest – SUBSTANCES.
                    The course is simple:
                    • Download the sample pack from our bio
                    • Create an original 3–5 min. track following the provided guidelines
                    • Send it to us – your creation will be evaluated by our jury and listeners
                    Send the track over to label.fosfor@gmail.com by May 1st. The best tracks will be featured
                    on our SoundCloud, and those with the most support will receive additional prizes from us
                    and our sponsors.
                    Show us what form sound can take.

            <h3>2025</h3>
            <p>On August 1st, the project moved forward and arrived in Vilnius. Fosfor made its debut at SODAS 2123 — a space where
noise feels natural, where concrete absorbs everything but energy, and where creation is allowed to speak for itself.
The night unfolded in dark, dense, broken forms of sound. Carefully selected guests, live performances, and our resident
crew shaped the atmosphere, each perspective adding a new layer until it formed a single textured whole</p>
